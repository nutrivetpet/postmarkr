The goal of postmarkr is to interact with the [Postmark
API](https://postmarkapp.com/developer), from R.

It is an independent, community-developed R package for the
[Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com) email service (not created by or
affiliated with Postmark).

## Installation

``` r
library(postmarkr)
dat <- template_send_email_batch(
  from = "xyz@mail.com",
  to = c( # potentially, a long vector of emails
    "abcd@mail.com",
    "efgh@mail.com"
  ),
  id = 36620093L,
  template_model = list(
    template_var_01 = "nutrivetpet",
    template_var_02 = "www.nutrivetpet.com"
  ),

  track_opens = TRUE
)
```
