The goal of postmarkr is to interact with the [Postmark API](https://postmarkapp.com/developer), from R.

It is an independent, community-developed R package for the [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com) email service (**not created by or affiliated with Postmark**).

## Installation

You can install the development version of postmarkr like so:

``` r
pak::pak("nutrivetpet/postmarkr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(postmarkr)
dat <- template_send_email_batch(
  from = "xyz@mail.com",
  to = c(
    "abcd@mail.com",
    "efgh@mail.com"
  ),
  id = 36620093L,
  template_model = list(
    template_var_01 = "nutrivetpet",
    template_var_02 = "www.nutrivetpet.com"
  ),
  msg_stream = "broadcast",
  tag = "test",
  track_opens = TRUE
)
```

## Features

- **Single Email Delivery**: Send individual emails with `email_send_single()`
- **Template-Based Emails**: Send templated emails with `template_send_email()` and `template_send_email_batch()`
- **Email Templates**: List available email templates with `template_list()`
- **Message Logs**: Retrieve outbound messages with `outbound_messages_collect()` and `outbound_messages_fetch()`
- **Delivery Statistics**: Track email performance with `stats_outbound_overview()`

**Note:** API coverage is still pretty limited compared to all available endpoints.
